Disclamer
-------
This was my first iOS application. The code is pretty crappy, but You have to start somewhere, you know.   
The application will probably never be updated, and there's probably a lot of bugs, and looooaaaadddssss of things I'd do differently.

What is it ?
-------

Aren't you tired of using dozens of applications to contact your friends ?
+ Phone.app,
+ Messages.app,
+ Mail.app,
+ FaceTime.app...

Well, I am. So I decided to write my own application.  
It's design to call, mail, send a message or a iMessage easily and quickly.

What ? It's not fast enough ? Alright, I'll add favorites, so you can contact your friends in one click !   
But remember, I'm still working on it when I have free time, so stay tuned.

How can I get it ?

[Here you go](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/simplecontact/id683951051?mt=8)


Can I see it ?
-------
Here is the default view of the application :  
![Main view](https://raw.github.com/DCMaxxx/EasyContact/master/Screenshots/Main%20view.png)

You can swipe on a contact to reveal buttons to call him, send him a mail... :

And of course, you can select which number you want to call :

If you have added a number into favorites, just go to the favorite's view to call / text / FaceTime / Mail it.

I'll update picture with new features.


Can I give my opinion ?
-------
Of course ! I'd love to here from you.
